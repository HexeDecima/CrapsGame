# RULES

**Come-Out Roll:**
You roll two dice.
  * If the sum is 7 or 11, you win right away.
  * If the sum is 2, 3, or 12 (called “craps”), you lose immediately.
  * If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, that number becomes your point.

**Point Phase:**
Once a point is set, you keep rolling the dice.
  * If you roll the point number again before rolling a 7, you win.
  * If you roll a 7 before the point, you lose.
